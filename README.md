# Diffie Hellman Encryption Algorithms

This repository contains two implementations of the Diffie Hellman key exchange protocol:

1. **Diffie Hellman over Prime Fields**  
2. **Diffie Hellman over Elliptic Curves**

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
|-- src/
    |-- assignment01.cpp   # Implementation of Diffie Hellman over Prime Fields
    |-- assignment02.cpp   # Implementation of Diffie Hellman over Elliptic Curves


## Requirements

- Programming Language: C++17
- Standard libraries only (as per [C++ Standard Library Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/standard_library))
- Each program must compile into a single executable: `a.exe`.

## Execution

#### Compilation

To compile the code:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o a.exe bai1.cpp  # For Diffie Hellman over Prime Fields
g++ -std=c++17 -o a.exe bai2.cpp  # For Diffie Hellman over Elliptic Curves
```

#### Execution

Run the compiled program with input and output files:
```bash
./a.exe test.inp test.out
```

## Academic Integrity

Plagiarism or sharing solutions with peers is strictly prohibited and will result in a score of zero for all involved parties.
